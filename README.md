# Snake
A simple version of the classic Snake game (mainly for me to learn Python and practice OOP)

# How to Play
- Simply use the directional arrow keys on your keyboard to control the head of the snake!
- Maneuver the head of the snake to collect the food (indicated by the red squares)
- Avoid running into your own tail as well as the borders of the display
